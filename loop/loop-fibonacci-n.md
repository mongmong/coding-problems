# Loop - Fibonacci N

## Problem

Fibonacci sequence is a series of non-negative numbers starting with 0 and 1:

    0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ...

Given n (n >= 1), print the first n numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.

## Hints

Use for loop to print the first n number.

## Example

Input:

    n = 8

Output:

    0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13
